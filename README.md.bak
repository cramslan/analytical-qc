## README

The Analytical QC application consists of four components:

- Database
- Static content
- Backend
- Frontend

### Database

The database contains substance, sample, experiment, and file information along with structured and freeform annotations. It is currently located at ccte-postgres-res.dmap-prod.aws.epa.gov, under database res_gsincl01_qsar and schema sbox_analytical_qc. DDL and CSV table exports are located in the db directory of this project.

### Static content (content-server)

Static files are served from a directory by an nginx server. The directory containing all files is currently located at L:/Lab/NCCT_Richard/Antony Williams/analytical-qc_GFBS_010722/analytical-qc_content-server_static.tar.gz. The contents of this file (~10 GB) should be extracted into the content-server/static directory of this project for deployment.

### Backend (server)

A database API served by a Spring Boot web service.

### Frontend (client)

A frontend interface in Vue.js, running on an nginx server.
